/**
 * IMPORTANT: This file is very special in what you can do in here and will do the very last steps
 * of copying sections and launching the game.
 *
 * In particular, the game expects its sections to be written to specific addresses that overlap with those of the launcher code,
 * so naively reading the sections from the disc to where they need to be will not work as we would overwrite/corrupt the launcher code
 * in the middle of the section copy loop.
 *
 * To get around this, we copy the function to a "safe address space" that we know is (a) not used and (b) does not overlap with any sections.
 *
 * Caveats to keep in mind when interacting with this file/function:
 * - You cannot reference any symbols (this includes calling functions, although function pointers are fine),
 *   as they are compiled to branching to relative offsets, which won't be correct anymore when the function machine code is copied elsewhere.
 * - This file needs to be compiled with -f-nobuiltin so that memset/memcpy loops aren't compiled to memset calls and run into point 1.
 * - When calling patch_dol, you need to also set the stack pointer to the safe space so that local variables are not overwritten.
 *   (Ideally we would use __attribute__((naked)) so that the function can manage its own stack space but that's not available for PPC...)
 * - You must make sure that no other threads are running that share the address space.
 *
 * We also need to call `DCFlushRange()` to invalidate the data cache after copying sections, however since we cannot reference symbols,
 * we require the caller to pass it as a function pointer.
 *
 * This file is compiled separately to a .o file and linked together with the main code again so that we can know the function length ahead of time.
